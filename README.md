# PicPay QA Engineer Challenge

## Installing dependencies to run the project.
Basically, this project is divided into two repositories: <b> picpay-mobile </b>, <b> picpay-frontend </b>.
But together, in a single repository, picpay, using Github subtree. 

<br> All information for installing the premises, tools and other details were made with the highest possible level 
of care in order to make it easy for anyone to run the tests.

Any doubt, the repository is open for forks and new implementations. :) <br>
